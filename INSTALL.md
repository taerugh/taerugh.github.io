# Local setup using Docker

Using Docker to install Jekyll and Ruby dependencies is the easiest way.

You need to take the following steps to get `al-folio` up and running on your local machine:

- First, install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- Finally, run the following command that will pull the latest pre-built image from DockerHub and will run your website.

```bash
$ docker compose pull
$ docker compose up
```

Note that when you run it for the first time, it will download a docker image of size 400MB or so. To see the template running, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`. You should see a copy of the theme's demo website.

Now, feel free to customize the theme however you like (don't forget to change the name!). Also, your changes should be automatically rendered in real-time (or maybe after a few seconds).

> Beta: You can also use the slimmed docker image with a size below 100MBs and exact same functionality. Just use `docker compose -f docker-compose-slim.yml up`
