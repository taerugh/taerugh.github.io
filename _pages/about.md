I'm a cofounder at [Clippership](https://www.clippership.co), where I'm building autonomous cargo sailboats to decarbonize and improve the maritime shipping industry. I want to make a positive impact on the world by solving engineering problems with a first principles approach.

I studied at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu), where I majored in mechanical engineering and minored in computer science. I also interned at [Xos](https://www.xostrucks.com) and [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com), where I worked on battery testing machines, prototype vehicles, and robotic arms. I spent a year as a masters student at [Carnegie Mellon](https://www.cmu.edu), where I studied controls and robotics, advised by [Zac Manchester](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zacmanchester) at the [Robotic Exploration Lab](https://rexlab.ri.cmu.edu) in the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu), before taking a leave of absence to pursue Clippership.
